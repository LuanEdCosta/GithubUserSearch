I created this app to learn the basics of React Native. While testing things on JSX I researched the official React Native documentation and learned the concepts on the official React website.

I had a lot of demand for apps that would work on Android and iOS phones at work, so I decided to learn React for these reasons:

- It uses JavaScript
- I learn a lot from [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) and they use OMNI stack in their projects (which influenced me a lot to choose this stack too)
- The React and React Native community is very large
- Large companies use React or React Native, such as Facebook Uber, Twitch, Microsoft, Wix and many others
